# 6502
This project involves constructing a fully functional retro computer using the 6502 CPU, a classic yet straightforward microprocessor. Over several months, I built the computer from the ground up, learning key concepts in low-level computing and hardware design. The computer is capable of communicating with a terminal to display text. This project has allowed me to explore the fundamentals of computer architecture while developing hands-on skills in system design and troubleshooting. Kit based on beneater's 6502 computer series: https://eater.net/6502

# Running the project
Without the specific hardware, running any of the files is tricky. To do so download this emulator: https://github.com/sethm/symon. The actual machine code is located in programs/bios/tmp/6502.bin. Change the emulators settings by: Simulator/Switch emulated machine/Beneater and Simulator/CPU/65C02. Then go to File/Load ROM and select the 6502.bin
